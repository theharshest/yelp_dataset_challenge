The data directory contains four data files:

  data_feats.csv - contains the names of the data features
  restaurant_data.csv - contains numeric feature data for the restaurants
  meta_feats.csv - contains the names of the meta data features
  restaurant_meta.csv - contains the meta data for the restaurants

The data was filtered to include only restaurants located in Arizona, Nevada or Wisconsin.

Each row in the restaurant_meta.csv file provides the meta data for the corresponding data row in the
restaurant_data.csv file.  These two files contain column headers.

Each row in the data_feats.csv file provides the name of the feature for the corresponding column in
the restaurant_data.csv file.  Each row in the meta_feats.csv file provides the name of the feature
for the corresponding column in the restaurant_meta.csv file.

Summary statistics for the data set (as of Nov 6, 2014):

  13010 restaurants
    410 data features
      9 meta data features

To recreate the restaurant_data.csv and restaurant_meta.csv files, do the following:
