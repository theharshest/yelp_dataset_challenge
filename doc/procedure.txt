CONTENT OF TRAINING AND TEST DATA SETS

Datasets that will be generated for each round of cross validation.  The training and test sets will have similar content except that a different "prediction date" will be used to calculate the date dependent attributes.

Given a "prediction date" D, the samples will include the following attributes:
  attributes that are dependent on D
  - average star rating calculated using reviews submited before D
  - number of reviews submitted before D
  - number of tips submitted before D
  - sentiment rating calculated using reviews submitted before D
  - economic data available on D
  attributes that are NOT dependent on D
  - yelp attributes (ambiance, attire, price range, etc)
  - yelp categories (food type, location type)
  - census data (population, etc)

The class label for each restaurant will be calculated based on the "prediction date" D:
  - Closed 0-3 months after D
  - Closed 3-6 months after D
  - Closed 6-9 months after D
  - Closed 9-12 months after D
  - Still open 12 months after D

BASE DATA USED TO GENERATE TRAINING AND TEST DATA SETS

To support generating these data sets, the following base data sets will be available:

  restaurant_data.csv - includes the following attributes
  - business_id
  - first_review_date - used to estimate when the restaurant opened
  - last_review_date - used to estimate whe the restaurant closed
  - census_tract - links to the applicable census and economic data
  - attributes (many columns) - non time dependent attributes
  - categories (many columns) - non time dependent categories

  review_data.csv - includes the following attributes
  - review_id
  - business_id
  - user_id - could be used to link to weighting information
  - review_date - the date on which the review was submitted
  - stars - number of stars assigned by the reviewer
  - sentiment - potentially many columns derived from sentiment analysis performed on the review text

  tip_data.csv - includes the following attributes
  - business_id
  - user_id - could be used to link to weighting information
  - tip_date the date on which the tip was submitted
  - likes - could be used as a weighting factor?

  economic_data.csv - includes the following attributes
  - period - the time period to which the data applies
  - census_tract - identifies the census tract to which the data applies
  - economic information - potentially many columns (unemployement, median incme, etc)

  census_data.csv - includes the following attributes
  - census_tract - identifier for the census tract
  - demographic information - potentially many columns (population, etc)

GENERATING TRAINING AND TEST DATA SETS

Given a "prediction date" D, the required samples and class labels will be generated as
follows.  This procedure can be used to generate both training data sets and test data sets.

  1. Load restaurant_data.csv
  2. Filter the data to eliminate restaurant that don't meet the following criteria:
     - first_review_date <= D (restaurant opened on or before D)
     - last_review_date >= D (restaurnat wasn't already closed on D)
  3. Eliminate columns for attributes that will not be used (filter out the noise)
  4. Calculate a label for each restaurant:
     - Assign label 0 if D < last_review_date <= D+3mos
     - Assign label 1 if D+3mos < last_review_date <= D+6mos
     - Assign label 2 if D+6mos < last_review_date <= D+9mos
     - Assign label 3 if D+9mos < last_review_date <= D+12mos
     - Assign label 4 if D+12mos < last_review_date
  5. Load review_data.csv
  6. Filter the data to eliminate reviews that don't meet the following criterion:
     - review_date <= D
  7. Calculate the following attributes with the remaining review data:
     - number of reviews for each restaurant
     - average star rating for each restaurant
       - calculated as the (sum of stars awarded to the restaurant)/(number of reviews for restaurant)
     - average sentiment ranking for each restaurant (may be multiple sentiment columns)
  8. Load tip_data.csv
  9. Filter the data to eliminate tips that don't meet the following criterion:
     - tip_date <= D
 10. Calculate the following attributes with the remaining tip data:
     - number of tips for each restaurant
 11. Load economic_data.csv
 12. Filter the data to eliminate records that don't meet the following criteria:
     - time period includes D
 13. Use census_tract identifier to identify the economic data that goes with each restaurant
 14. Load census_data.csv
 15. Use census_tract identifier to identify the census data that goes with each restaurant
 16. Generate a data set with one row per restaurant and the following columns:
     - business_id
     - class label
     - yelp attributes (ambiance, attire, price range, etc)
     - yelp categories (food type, location type)
     - number of reviews
     - average star rating
     - average sentiment ranking - potentially multiple columns
     - number of tips
     - economic data - potentially multiple columns
     - census data - potentially multiple columns

We can either generate the data sets ahead of time and save them in files to be loaded.  Or generate the data sets on demand as they are needed.

CROSS-VALIDATION PROCEDURE

Each classifier will be tested using the following cross-validation procedure:

   1. Choose a value for T.  This will determine the gap between the training prediction
      date and the test prediction date.
   2. Set END equal to the overall latest review date
   3. Set D equal to the overall earliest review date plus 1 year (?)
      - this will give us at least 1 year of data for the first round
   4. Training set: generate or load the data set whose prediction date is D
   5. Test set: generate or load the data set whose prediction date is D + T
   6. Train the classifier using the training data set
   7. Test the classifier using the test data set
      - Keep track of #correct, #incorrect, error rate
   8. Set D equal to D + T
   9. If D < (END - T) go to step #4 else stop

Generate report showing the following:
- number correct, number incorrect and error rate for each round
- average error for all rounds
